# Project 1 - Search

This project was oriented towards writing search algorithms, heuristic creations and game state definitions.

### Search Algorithms
Famous AI search algorithms implemented
- DFS
- BFS
- UCS
- A* search

All these algorithms were implemented in a generic manner so they can be used
for any game states.

###Heuristic creations

I also created heuristics for A* search for various versions of the pacman game. An
example of this was the FoodSearchProblem where a consistent and admissible heuristic
had to be designed so that the pacman agent eats all the food in the maze
while expanding the lowest number of nodes possible.
